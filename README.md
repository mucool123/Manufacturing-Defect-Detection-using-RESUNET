In the vanguard of the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative forces in manufacturing. A pivotal application lies within the maintenance department, where the need for automation in defect detection is paramount. The problem at hand is the reactive nature of maintenance protocols, often resulting in halted production lines, wasted resources, and increased operational costs due to unrecognized or late-detected manufacturing defects.

Enlisted as an AI/ML consultant for a steel manufacturing company in San Diego, the challenge was to automate the defect detection process. The goal was to enhance the quality of manufacturing while minimizing waste associated with production defects. The task involved developing an AI model capable of detecting and localizing defects on steel surfaces in real-time, utilizing a dataset of 12,600 images, each annotated with types of defects and their precise locations.

To address this challenge, we proposed a sophisticated solution leveraging deep learning models. The strategy incorporated a ResNet Deep Learning Classifier Model and a ResUNet Segmentation Model into a layered deep learning pipeline. The models would be trained to perform both classification and segmentation, with the former identifying the presence of a defect and the latter localizing it on a pixel level. This dual approach ensures that defects are not only detected but also accurately mapped, allowing for immediate corrective measures.

Our objective was clear: to deliver a system that operates with high precision and recall, ensuring that no defect goes unnoticed, and to provide maintenance departments with actionable insights that enable proactive interventions. By achieving this, we aimed to significantly reduce downtime and enhance the overall efficiency and reliability of the manufacturing process.

This solution exemplifies the power of AI and ML in transforming maintenance operations. It stands as a testament to the potential of technology to elevate the standards of manufacturing and to the value of informed, data-driven decision-making in industrial settings.
